      <h2> Environment </h2>

      <strong>Chair:</strong> Kate Saunders
      <br><br>
      This session runs from 10:30-12:00 and focuses on tools for working with environmental data. Speakers are:
      <br><br>

      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Climate is What We Expect, Weather (Data) is What We Get Via APIs </strong> <br> <em> Adam Sparks,
            Curtin University </em>
          <p> No matter where we are, weather shapes our lives. We are all familiar with ordinary everyday weather
            concerns, do I need an umbrella when I step out the door today or maybe how cold will it be, will I need to
            wear a jacket later? Businesses use it to track long-term patterns and understand historical trends. Major
            media organisations use historical weather data to tell stories by visualising the data to show the effects
            of climate change to the public. Agricultural researchers use weather data in their analyses to help explain
            experimental results or build complex models that simulate farming systems. And governments use the data to
            prepare and plan for future disasters or understand seasonal trends to ensure adequate infrastructure is in
            place. While the uses are often critical, and the data may be freely or openly available, getting the data
            quickly and easily into R can be frustrating. There are 193 members of the World Meteorological Organisation
            (WMO), many of which offer some sort of programmatic access to historical weather data or forecasted weather
            data via APIs, but some do not, while there are other non-member organisations that do. I'll present the
            good, the bad and the ugly of different weather data sources and getting the data wrangled and tamed ready
            to go in your R session with what you need to think about for end users of the data when you make a weather
            data API client R package to help make our world more understandable.

        <li> <strong> Read, Manipulate and Plot Gridded Data with metR </strong> <br><em> Elio Campitelli, Monash
            University </em>
          <p> The metR package provides an assortment of tools for wrangling, plotting and analysing meteorological
            field data. It has been developed from my own research needs, originally in response to a lack of available
            tools. For example, a large number of functions are provided for plotting variations of filled contours,
            which preceded the ggplot2 filled contour functions. Because meteorological field data is delivered in
            NetCDF there is a function to read this type of file. Utility functions allow conversion between different
            different longitude conventions. Principal components is a primary analysis tool, so there are functions for
            this, along with various model fitting procedures. There are tools for imputation, finding anomalies and for
            model diagnostics. Writing a package tailored to what you, individually need, can be useful for others:
            philosophically, if I need it, probably others do too! </p>
        </li>
        <li> <strong> Open Air Quality directly in R with airpurifyr </strong> <br> <em> Michael Lydeamore, David Wu,
            Jayani Lakshika </em>
          <p> Air quality and pollution have emerged as critical research areas with implications across various policy
            domains, extending beyond traditional climate-focused studies. Despite this growing interest, many projects
            still rely on limited, ad-hoc datasets. I will introduce airpurifyr, a new R package designed to facilitate
            access to the OpenAQ Web API, a freely available and semi-curated global database of air quality
            measurements.
          <p> In addition to providing an overview of the airpurifyr package, I will showcase research conducted by our
            master's students, who have leveraged the OpenAQ API to enhance their data exploration skills and contribute
            to the field of air quality analysis.
          <p> By streamlining access to comprehensive air quality data, airpurifyr aims to empower researchers,
            policymakers, and students alike, fostering more robust analysis and evidence-based decision-making in the
            ongoing pursuit of cleaner, healthier air worldwide. </p>
