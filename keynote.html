	  Topic: <a href="keynote.html" target="_blank"> <em> S7: A New Object-oriented System for R </em></a> <br>
	  <br>
          Two core design philosophies of R are that R is extensible by users and everything is an object. Package developeRs seek to take advantage of these synergistic principles by defining their own types of objects, as well as extending objects defined in base R and third party packages. We propose S7, a new system for object-oriented programming in R that implements many of the advancements made by S4 on top of the more fundamental S3 system, while also bringing its own ideas to this area of research. This talk will outline the core features of S7 and demonstrate it through an object-oriented interface between R and Large Language Models (LLMs).
