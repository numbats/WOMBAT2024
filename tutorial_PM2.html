<strong> Tutorial details </strong>
<br>
<br>

We will take a practical approach to time-series forecasting. We will discuss each forecasting process step, including exploring and visualising time series, and we will also discuss practical approaches to evaluating the performance of forecasting solutions. The tutorial will cover popular forecasting methods, including smoothing algorithms, regression models, and ARIMA. Finally, we will discuss automated forecasting and the advantages of assembly methods. 

The material covered in this tutorial is inspired by the book <a href="https://www.forecastingbook.com"> Practical Time Series Forecasting with R: A Hands-On Guide</a>.<p>

<br>

<em> Background:</em> Participants should have a basic working knowledge of R and a little experience with ggplot2. This tutorial has many ‘hands-on’ activities. It is strongly recommended that you attend with your own laptop. Please ensure you have installed Rstudio, R and the recommended list of packages before the tutorial starts. If you are unfamiliar with writing R code or with using Rstudio, consider working through the first two chapters of <a href="https://learnr.numbat.space">the learnr materials</a>.</p>
