<h2> Fun stuff </h2>

<strong>Chair:</strong> Joan Tan
<br><br>
This session runs from 3:00-4:00 and focuses on fun activities that build analysis skills. Speakers are:
<br><br>

<ul>
   <li> <strong>MCG Taylor Swift Postcode Data Train Patronage Model  </strong> <br> <em> Belinda Maher, Metro Trains Melbourne </em> 
<p> Taylor Swift, the most streamed artist in Spotify’s history.
The Melbourne Cricket Ground, the largest stadium in the Southern Hemisphere.
96,000 ticket holders per night. The biggest shows of Taylor Swift's career. “Taylor-Gaters” hanging out outside. 3 nights in a row, like 3 consecutive AFL Grand Finals.
How do you get such a large crowd to the venue and home again from all over Melbourne, Victoria, Australia (and the world), all with no underground car park? By public transport of course!
Belinda will take you through her strategic model of how she estimated how many Swifties would be using each Metro train line from postcode-level ticketholder data.  </li>
   <li> <strong> Why build silly things R? </strong> <br><em> Fonti Kar, University of NSW </em> 
<p> Data science is an ever-evolving industry that requires constant upskilling. The pressures to learn the latest tools for project deliverables or to enhance one’s CV can be a hindrance to effective learning. Here, I argue for the need for silliness when developing new R skills. Learning is far more enjoyable and conducive to retention and application when we take away the seriousness of upskilling. I will share my experience in creating <a href="https://fontikar.github.io/ohwhaley/"> ohwhaley</a> - a <em> toy </em> R package which serves as a tool for learning package development and upskilling new learners. I hope attendees will walk away feeling more light-hearted and empowered to build silly things in R to reinvigorate their curiosity for R knowledge.
 </p> </li>
