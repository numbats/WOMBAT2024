<h2> Education </h2>

This session runs from 1:00-2:30 and focuses on tools for education. Speakers are:
<br><br>

<ul>
   <li> <strong>TBA (LearnR)  </strong> <br> <em> Mitch O'Hara-Wild and Cynthia Huang, Monash University </em> 
<p> TBA </li>
   <li> <strong> Developing tools for “real time” formative assessment of writing within large introductory statistics and data science courses </strong> <br><em> Anna Fergusson, University of Auckland </em> 
<p> Various data technologies and automated approaches can assist with teaching and assessment, but care is needed to develop tools and practices that value and support the human learning experience, at the same time as optimising for efficiency and accuracy. For instance, introductory-level statistics and data science students need to learn how to identify and produce short written communications (including code) that are statistically and computationally sound. However, there are challenges to designing and implementing effective formative assessment of student writing and coding when courses involve hundreds or thousands of students, and scalable methods of support are needed. This talk will present pedagogical and technological explorations for developing tools that support “real time” and large-scale formative assessment of writing (including code), as well as plans for further research involving the integration of statistical pairwise-comparison ranking models and NLP algorithms.
