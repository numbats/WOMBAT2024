<strong> Tutorial details </strong>
<br>

Most analyses start with the analyst experimenting with R code in a script or a notebook. But what happens when this experimental work becomes mission critical and starts being used to make real-world decisions? This tutorial will cover the basics of converting experimental R code into high-quality Production grade R software that can be relied on. It will cover hands-on demonstrations of tools and techniques such as R packages, functional code, documentation, testing, hosting and deployment.
